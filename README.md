## Building

First, to build it and test in your phone or emulator, you will need to have the flutter installed and configured in your computer, in general do it is very simple, so do not be worry. 

_Follow the documentation about flutter to install: [click here][flutter_install]._

In time, this application was developed with the most recent libraries developed for flutter, so, be sure to have the most recent version of flutter to support it.

In second place you will need to have an emulator to build a debug mode app and test it, but when you install flutter it guides you to have this alerady installed and configured in your computer. But if you want to test the app in your phone (I preffer to do it to have a better experiences over development), so you can plug-in your phone over USB connection and make sure to have the developer mode enable in your phone configurations (For Android, that is what i use to develop for now). 

_As a trick to test over WiFi connection, when you install Android Studio (Needed for develop on android mode and explained on flutter install documentation.) you got a command called `adb`, this command can enable computer to accept a phone connection over WiFi, so follow this:_

_With a phone plugged in USB (for the first time) and in the same wifi connection of computer, type in terminal:_
```bash
$ adb tcpid 5555
```

_After that your phone will be enabled to connect to computer, so to connect just type:_
```bash
$ adb connect 192.168.x.x 5555
```
_where `192.168.x.x` needs to be the ip of your phone on network._

Ok, now that you already have a phone or emulator configured and ready to receive our application, you need to run the follow command to build a debug app and install.

```bash
$ flutter run
```

_It will install a debug mode of application in your phone, in this moment, pay attention for Android because it show a little window to allow the installation and it hides after 10 seconds, so watch your phone._

Well, in this moment you should have see the app running in your phone or emulator and can enjoy it, but if you want to build the app (to publish or have the best performance of flutter in your phone), i recommend you to follow [this link][flutter_build] that guides you step-by-step, from generatin your keystore until create your appbundle.

## Congradulations, You're done._

I hope this documentation has been made clear and help you to build the application and see it in your hands.
